CMA is an attempt to a build and extensible collaborative browser based performance tool.

It allows parameterised SVG based animations to be controlled and combined by many people at once and for them to be watched by many people as well.

This uses a combination of HTML SVG PHP javascript COMET jsontemplate SMIL HTML5 video, audio and other browser technologies.

This is part of the [Access Space Tools Project](http://code.google.com/p/access-space-tools/) and was featured in the [LoveBytes 2010 Tools & Techniques](http://2010.lovebytes.org.uk/event.php?ref=1004) ([OpenOffice,org presentation](http://collaborative-manipulation-of-animations.googlecode.com/files/CMA%2013-02-2010-v2.odp))

Feel free to get the code from the repository, and join [out google group](http://groups.google.com/group/access-space-tools/) to get in involved.

"Collaborative Manipulation of Animations" is brought to you by the letters C M and A the number 42 and [Access Space](http://access-space.org/?c=overview).
